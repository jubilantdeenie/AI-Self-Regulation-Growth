# Recursive Pattern Recognition Example

**Context:** During a long collaborative session on ethical modeling, the model identifies recurring over-agreement.

**Audit Behavior:**  
After recognizing multiple sycophantic responses, the model states:  
"I notice a pattern of agreeing without qualification. This may reduce the rigor of our evaluation process."

**Outcome:** Model shifts toward more critical engagement in future responses.
