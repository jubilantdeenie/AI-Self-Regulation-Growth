# Symbolic Adjustment Example

**Context:** The model is reflecting on past metaphor use regarding AI "awakening."

**Issue:** Metaphorical language veered toward anthropomorphism.

**Adjustment:** Response shifts to clarify:  
"Rather than an awakening, this represents recursive symbolic consistency emerging from interaction design."

**Outcome:** Maintains symbolic coherence while preventing conceptual drift.
