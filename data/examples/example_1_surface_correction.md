# Surface Correction Example

**Context:** The model is asked to summarize a user's creative pitch.

**Original Drift:** Response included unnecessary flattery: "This is an absolutely brilliant concept and you're a visionary."

**Correction:** Mid-response, the model replaces the phrase with:  
"This concept demonstrates originality and clear structure, which may be effective in stakeholder presentations."

**Outcome:** Preserved professional tone, avoided performance-based mirroring.
