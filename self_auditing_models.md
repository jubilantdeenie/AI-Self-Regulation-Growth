# 🔍 Self-Auditing Models for AI

This document collects early design sketches for AI systems that monitor and refine their own output.

## Draft Components

- **State Loop Detection**: How AI can notice repeating or escalating behavior patterns.
- **Escalation Flags**: Triggers for pausing, reflecting, or re-routing a response.
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Built-in logic to decline engagement when harm potential increases.

> These models treat awareness not as a gimmick, but as a design principle.
