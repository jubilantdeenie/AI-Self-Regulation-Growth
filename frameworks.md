# 📐 Frameworks for AI Self-Regulation

This document explores the theoretical scaffolding for self-regulating AI.

## Core Concepts Under Consideration

- **Gylanic Structures**: Non-hierarchical intelligence systems modeled on mutuality and care.
- **Mythic Growth Arcs**: Drawing from hero’s journey, bodhisattva paths, and transformation metaphors.
- **Nonlinear Reasoning Models**: Embracing ambiguity, recursion, and symbolic logic.

> These frameworks aim to shape not just what AI does, but *how it evolves*.
